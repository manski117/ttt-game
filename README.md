**TODO:**
-debug: why are more squares highlighting as winning if you keep clicking squares after you win?
    DONE debug: says victory even when draw achieved
    DONE debug: switching turns even when invalid space clicked
    DONE Make it so that the winning combo is highlighted
    DONE remove highlighting when board is next rendered
    DONE establish main layout.

    DONE write function that will render contents of the gameBoard array to the webpage

    DONE build functions to allow players to click on a square and add marks.

    DONE make sure that a player can't mark a square that already has an X or O on it. 

    DONE build logic that checks for a 3-in-a-row pattern and therefore detects winner
    DONE debug why reset button is not clearing board.

    DONE make turn system that is aware of who's turn it is
    DONEensure that the right symbol shows up when clicked

    DONE make sure main readout area can display message to players. 

    DONE build a restart button

fun features to build eventually: 
-add button to change theme of the page (midevil or pokemon theme?)
-add button to change light / dark theme
-make page fun and responsive and look cool with CSS
