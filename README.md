Building a tic tac toe game in browser through the Odin Project as a way to practice concepts related to factory functions, modules, and objects



**TODO:**
    DONE establish main layout.

    DONE write function that will render contents of the gameBoard array to the webpage

    DONE build functions to allow players to click on a square and add marks.

    DONE make sure that a player can't mark a square that already has an X or O on it. 

    DONE build logic that checks for a 3-in-a-row pattern and therefore detects winner

-make turn system that is aware of who's turn it is
    -ensure that the right symbol shows up when clicked

-make sure main readout area can display message to players. 

    DONE build a restart button

fun features to build eventually: 
-add button to change theme of the page (midevil or pokemon theme?)
-add button to change light / dark theme
-make page fun and responsive and look cool with CSS
