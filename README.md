Building a tic tac toe game in browser through the Odin Project as a way to practice concepts related to factory functions, modules, and objects



**TODO:**
-establish main layout.

-write function that will render contents of the gameBoard array to the webpage

-build functions to allow players to click on a square and add marks.

-make sure that a player can't mark a square that already has an X or O on it. 

-build logic that checks for a 3-in-a-row pattern and therefore detects winner

-make sure main readout area can display message to players. 

-build a restart button

fun features to build eventually: 
-add button to change theme of the page (midevil or pokemon theme?)
-add button to change light / dark theme
-make page fun and responsive and look cool with CSS
